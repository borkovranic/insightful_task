Assignment
Your task is to create an automated test case using a testing framework (preferably cross
platform framework). The goal of the test case is to calculate the exchange rate in USD and EUR,
given the value in RSD and compare the results from the website and the OS calculator app.

Requirements:

Develop an automated test case that covers the following steps:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the following currency exchange rate website
https://www.xe.com/.

2. Convert values 1000, 2000 and 3000 from RSD to EUR and USD and save the results in a
text file.

3. Retrieve the exchange rates from the webpage.

4. Close the browser.

5. Open a desktop (operating system) calculator application and perform a calculation
using the exchange rates and convert values 1000, 2000 and 3000 from RSD to EUR and
USD and save the results in a text file.

6. Make assertions and confirm that the values from the website and the calculator are the
same.

Additional Requirements (bonus):
a. Complete the task on at least two different operating systems (Windows, Linux,
macOS).
b. Use two exchange offices on the web and then compare the results with the
calculator (https://wise.com/gb/currency-converter/ and https://www.xe.com/).
