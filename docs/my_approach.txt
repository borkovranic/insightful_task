Once accessed xe.com i noticed that for the first execution, convert button redirects to conversion page, showing resulst.

Idea was to repeat the process for each amount for defined currency:
- get homepage
- input rsd currency to original FROM currrency field
- input target currency to original to TO currrency field
- input amount
- click convert buttton
- extract results from conversion area
- repeat for each amount and target currency

Once i was at the converting page, i noticed that i can directly change amount, and conversion will happen automatically.
However, convert button was missing then.
Another challenge, framework was too fast, extracted conversion value before the amounts were converted here.
I noticed there is loading indicator, and then waitting for it dinamically to dissapear, then get converted values.

My idea was to create a file with results from calculator calculations, and format them in same manner as web results are saved, then compare the lines in the both files.

I had idea but not the time, to create one base_exchange.py file with class containging the methods equal as such for both websites.
Then i would have 2 class for each shop that would inheridate the methods from super class, while each for itself handling the convert button, loading indicator and/or any specific logic within them.
- input From currency
- input To currency
- input amount
- get conversion results
