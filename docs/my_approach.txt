Once accessed xe.com i noticed that for the first execution, convert button redirects to conversion page, showing resulst.

Idea was to repeat the process for each amount for defined currency:
- get homepage
- input rsd currency to original FROM currrency field
- input target currency to original to TO currrency field
- input amount
- click convert buttton
- extract results from conversion area
- repeat for each amount and target currency

Once i was at the converting page, i noticed that i can directly change amount, and conversion will happen automatically.
However, convert button was missing then.
Another challenge, framework was too fast, extracted conversion value before the amounts were converted here.
I noticed there is loading indicator, and then waitting for it dinamically to dissapear, then get converted values.

My idea was to create a file with results from calculator calculations, and format them in same manner as web results are saved, then compare the lines in the both files.

I had idea but not the time, to create one base_exchange.py file with class containging the methods equal as such for both websites.
Then i would have 2 class for each shop that would inheridate the methods from super class, while each for itself handling the convert button, loading indicator and/or any specific logic within them.
- input From currency
- input To currency
- input amount
- get conversion results

UPDATE:
While executing the case for XE about 50 times, i noticed that stability can be improved, opposed to last week executions.
Sometimes input amounts was done too fast, causing input process to be retried due to speediness and loading indicator disappearing not being detected.
I improved detecting loading indicator.
However, i added TC002, which is triggering parametrized URL, directly opening conversion page with prefilled values.
This is might not be the best practice, but it is working quite good.

NOTE: Test case failure can be caused by conversion rate being captured miliseconds after the conversion.
As the conversion rates are changing at some decimal place all the time,
that can cause second or third decimal to mismatch once calculating the conversions with calculator.
